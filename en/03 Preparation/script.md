# ARROYO® 1K Waterborne White Topcoat - Preparation

## Video Overview
This module covers essential substrate preparation, wood conditioning, stain compatibility, blocking, and other pre-finishing steps necessary for optimal ARROYO® 1K performance.

## Slide 1: Why Preparation Matters

### Narrative
In woodworking, there's an old saying: "Preparation is ninety percent of finishing." When it comes to ARROYO® 1K, this couldn't be more true.

No topcoat can overcome poor substrate preparation. The cleaner and better prepared your surface, the better your finish will be. Taking time upfront to prepare properly saves time and frustration later.

ARROYO® 1K is a water-based product, which means it requires slightly different preparation than solvent-based finishes. Water-based topcoats have less penetrating power, so surface preparation becomes even more critical.

## Slide 2: Assessing Your Substrate

### Narrative
Before you begin preparation, evaluate what you're working with.

For new wood, you'll start from bare wood and follow standard preparation procedures. New wood preparation is typically straightforward and yields the best results.

For previously finished pieces, determine what finish is currently on the piece. If it's a protective finish like lacquer or polyurethane, you'll need to strip or sand it completely.

If the existing finish is in good condition and well-adhered, you can sometimes work over it with proper sanding and cleaning.

Always test on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure compatibility.

## Slide 3: Sanding Progression

### Narrative
Proper sanding creates the ideal surface for ARROYO® 1K adhesion.

Start with coarser grits to remove defects, old finishes, or imperfections. Begin with 80 to 120-grit sandpaper for aggressive removal of existing finishes or significant flaws.

Progress to medium grits—150 to 180-grit—to refine the surface and remove scratches from coarser paper.

Finish with fine grits—220-grit or finer—to create a smooth, consistent surface that ARROYO® 1K can adhere to perfectly.

Always sand with the grain, never against it. Cross-grain sanding creates scratches that become visible under clear topcoats.

---

## Slide 4: Dust Removal

### Narrative
Dust is the enemy of a quality finish. After sanding, meticulous dust removal is non-negotiable.

Begin with a soft brush to remove loose dust from all surfaces, edges, and recesses. A stiff brush works well for rough or carved surfaces.

Follow with a vacuum equipped with a fine-dust filter or a tack cloth to capture remaining particles. For best results, use both in sequence.

A tack cloth is slightly sticky and captures dust particles without leaving residue. Use it with light pressure just before finishing to ensure a dust-free surface.

Pay special attention to details, corners, edges, and turnings where dust loves to hide.

## Slide 5: Surface Cleanliness

### Narrative
Beyond dust, other contaminants can interfere with ARROYO® 1K adhesion.

**Wax:** If the wood has been treated with wax or teak oil, you must remove it. Wax prevents water-based products from adhering. Use appropriate strippers or sanding if necessary.

**Silicone:** Silicone is particularly problematic with water-based finishes. It creates adhesion failure and finish defects. Clean thoroughly with a dewaxing solution or solvent.

**Oils and Resins:** Some woods naturally contain oils or resins that can interfere. Wipe the surface with a solvent like mineral spirits to remove excess oils before finishing.

**Moisture:** If the piece was wet or damp, allow it to dry completely before finishing. Moisture is absorbed into wood grain and prevents proper finish adhesion.

---

## Slide 6: Wood Conditioning

### Narrative
Different wood species absorb finishes differently. Proper conditioning ensures uniform color and appearance.

Softwoods like pine and fir absorb finish unevenly, creating blotchy appearance. Pre-stain wood conditioner seals the surface and prevents uneven absorption.

Apply wood conditioner to all surfaces that will receive stain or topcoat. Wait the recommended time—typically 15 minutes—before applying your next coat.

For hardwoods, conditioning is optional but often beneficial. Even dense woods like walnut can benefit from conditioning for more uniform appearance.

Let conditioning dry completely per product instructions before proceeding.

## Slide 7: Stain Application and Compatibility

### Narrative
If you're using stain before ARROYO® 1K, ensure compatibility and proper technique.

ARROYO® 1K works well with most stain types, but verify compatibility:
- Oil-based stains: Excellent compatibility; ensure complete drying
- Water-based stains: Good compatibility; they dry quickly
- Gel stains: Good compatibility; apply per product directions
- Dye stains: Generally compatible; test first

Always apply stain to a test piece first, then topcoat it with ARROYO® 1K to verify compatibility and appearance.

Allow stain to cure fully before topcoating. While some stains dry quickly, full cure takes 24 to 48 hours depending on the product.

---

## Slide 8: Grain Raising and Sanding After Stain

### Narrative
When stain is dry, an important phenomenon occurs: grain raising.

Water in the stain causes wood fibers to absorb moisture and swell, raising the grain texture. This becomes sandpaper-rough to the touch.

To achieve a smooth final finish, you must sand out the raised grain. Use 220-grit or finer sandpaper with light pressure. Sand only enough to feel smooth—you're not trying to remove the stain.

After sanding, carefully remove all dust with a tack cloth. This sanding step is crucial for the silky smoothness that ARROYO® 1K is known for.

---

## Slide 9: Sealer Considerations

### Narrative
In some cases, using a sealer before topcoat improves results.

Sealers help:
- Control bleed-through of extractives from wood
- Provide better adhesion for topcoat
- Reduce the number of topcoats needed
- Improve color uniformity

Choose a sealer compatible with both your stain and ARROYO® 1K. Waterborne sealers are ideal for this purpose.

Apply sealer per product instructions, typically one thin coat. Sand lightly before topcoating with ARROYO® 1K.

---

## Slide 10: End Grain Treatment

### Narrative
End grain requires special attention as it absorbs finish differently than face grain.

End grain is more porous and absorbs stain and topcoat unevenly, often appearing darker or rougher.

Pre-condition end grain with wood conditioner applied slightly heavier than on face grain. Allow it to dry fully before staining.

After staining, you may need an extra sealer coat on end grain areas to ensure uniform topcoat appearance.

Carefully sand and dust end grain before topcoating to ensure adhesion.

## Slide 11: Special Surfaces and Details

### Narrative
Preparing intricate details and special surfaces requires extra care.

**Turnings and Carvings:** Pay special attention to detailed areas where dust accumulates. Use a soft brush and compressed air if available.

**Inlays and Veneers:** Ensure all seams are clean and free of dust. If seams are open, they'll require special attention before finishing.

**Previously Finished Edges:** If you're refinishing over existing finish, ensure edges are properly sanded and free of old finish residue.

**Hardware Mounting Areas:** Mask areas where hardware will be mounted to prevent finish buildup that might interfere with proper assembly.

---

## Slide 12: Environmental Preparation

### Narrative
The finish area itself requires preparation for best results.

**Dust Control:** Minimize air movement and dust generation. Close doors and windows to prevent dust intrusion during finishing.

**Temperature:** Maintain 50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal preparation and finishing.

**Humidity:** Ensure relative humidity is between 40 and 70 percent. Very humid conditions slow drying; very dry conditions cause application issues.

**Lighting:** Ensure adequate lighting to see all surfaces clearly. Quality preparation requires seeing what you're working with.

## Slide 13: Final Inspection

### Narrative
Before you apply ARROYO® 1K, conduct a final inspection of your prepared surface.

Run your hand across the surface—it should feel smooth with no sanding scratches. Look for dust or debris under bright light. Check edges, corners, and details for overlooked preparation areas.

If you're satisfied, you're ready for topcoating. If not, address issues now—it's much easier than trying to fix them after ARROYO® 1K is applied.

This final inspection is your quality gate. Take the time to get it right.
