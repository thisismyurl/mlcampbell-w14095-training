## Key Guidelines

- **Authority**: Everything comes from the SDS. If the script says something not in the SDS, rewrite it.
- **Distributor Focus**: You're helping sales staff explain safety to customers. You're not writing for end users.
- **Tone**: Professional and clear, not scary. Acknowledge the hazard honestly, then explain how to handle it safely.
- **Brevity**: Each section 45-90 seconds. Total script under 5 minutes. If you need more, split into two videos.
- **Voice-Over Format**: Write for someone to read aloud. Short sentences. No jargon unless it's in the SDS.
- **Grade 10 Reading Level**: If a sentence takes more than 15 words, break it into two sentences.
- **Safety Grabber**: First 15-20 seconds establish the hazard. Keep it professional.
- **Safety Reminder**: Last 15-30 seconds point to the SDS as the complete source.
- **Positive Framing**: Say "Proper ventilation keeps people safe" not "Improper ventilation kills people."
- **Real Scenarios**: Use distributor-relevant examples: "A customer calls asking about fumes..."

## Critical Safety Points
- ⚠ **Safety comes from understanding the SDS** - not from guessing or assumptions
- ⚠ **Your job is to point customers to the SDS** - this is how they learn to use safely
- ⚠ **Always get the product-specific SDS** - different products have different hazards
- ⚠ **Proper ventilation, PPE, and storage protect people** - these are non-negotiable
- ⚠ **Know what to do if something goes wrong** - before problems happen

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ✗ Claiming something is safe when the SDS shows it's a hazard
- ✗ Over-simplifying and leaving out important safety details
- ✗ Using complex language that sales staff can't explain to customers
- ✗ Giving medical advice - point to the SDS and medical professionals instead
- ✗ Creating a 10-minute safety lecture when a 5-minute explanation works better
- ✗ Forgetting that your audience is distributors helping customers, not chemists
