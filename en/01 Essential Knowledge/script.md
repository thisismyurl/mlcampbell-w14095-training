## Slide 2: What is ARROYO® 1K?
<!-- Slide Duration: ~75 seconds | Purpose: Define the product and technology -->

### Narrative
ARROYO® 1K stands for "one-component" waterborne topcoat. Unlike two-part systems that require mixing a resin with a hardener, ARROYO® 1K comes ready to use right out of the container.

The "waterborne" technology means it uses water as the primary carrier instead of volatile organic compounds—or V-O-C-s. This makes it environmentally friendly, low-odor, and safer to use in your shop.

Key characteristics:
- Single-component formulation
- Waterborne technology
- Ready-to-use application
- Fast drying properties
- Exceptional clarity for white finishes
