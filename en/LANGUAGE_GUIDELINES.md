# Language Guidelines - English

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Distributors and sales staff
- **Secondary**: Briefing customers
- Adult learners with product familiarity
- English as a first or second language
- Busy professionals (need quick, focused content)

## Writing Principles

### DO:
- **Use simple, everyday language**
  - Grade 10 reading level
  - Example: "dry quickly" instead of "accelerated curing time"
  - Example: "needs good ventilation" instead of "requires adequate air exchange"
  - Example: "water-based" instead of "aqueous formulation"

- **Use short sentences** (10-15 words max)
  - Optimized for voice-over delivery
  - Easier for listeners to follow
  - Allows natural pauses for emphasis

- **Use active voice**
  - ✓ "This product protects wood from water"
  - ✗ "Wood protection is provided by this product"

- **Explain technical terms when necessary**
  - First use: "VOC (volatile organic compounds) - materials that evaporate into the air"
  - Subsequent uses: Use the term normally

- **Use concrete examples**
  - Show real applications
  - Reference familiar scenarios
  - Avoid abstract concepts

- **Number lists and steps clearly**
  - Step 1, Step 2, Step 3
  - Makes it easy to follow along
  - Good for visual representation

### AVOID:
- ✗ Jargon and technical acronyms without explanation
- ✗ Complex sentence structures
- ✗ Passive voice constructions
- ✗ Assumptions about prior knowledge
- ✗ Fast-paced delivery without pauses
- ✗ Multiple ideas in a single sentence

## Tone
- **Friendly and encouraging** - not condescending
- **Professional but approachable** - not stiff or formal
- **Confident and clear** - not uncertain or vague
- **Respectful** - acknowledge the learner's intelligence while simplifying content

## Script Length Guidelines
- **All videos**: Maximum 5 minutes (approximately 600-750 words for voice-over)
- **If content is longer**, break into separate segments
- **Each segment** must have its own safety grabber and reminder
- **Rule of thumb**: 1 minute ≈ 120-150 spoken words

## Accessibility
- Include pauses between sections
- Emphasize important safety information
- Repeat key concepts at the end
- Use natural speech patterns, not robotic delivery

## Voice-Over Format
- **Written for spoken delivery**, not reading
- **Mark natural pauses** where listeners absorb information
- **Emphasize key safety points** with tone variation
- **Repeat important concepts** at closing
- **Conversational tone** - professional but approachable
