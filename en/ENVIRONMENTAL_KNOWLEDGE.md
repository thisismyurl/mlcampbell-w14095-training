## Key Guidelines

- **Authority**: Everything comes from the EDS. If the script says something not in the EDS, rewrite it.
- **Distributor Focus**: Help sales staff answer customer questions about environmental impact and compliance.
- **Honesty**: Explain real benefits (low VOC, certifications) without exaggerating. Don't claim "eco-friendly" if the EDS doesn't support it.
- **Brevity**: Each section 60-90 seconds. Total script under 5 minutes. If you need more, split into two videos.
- **Voice-Over Format**: Write for someone to read aloud. Short sentences. Avoid technical jargon.
- **Grade 10 Reading Level**: If a sentence takes more than 15 words, break it into two sentences.
- **Customer Focus**: Answer the question: "Why should my customer care about this environmental feature?"
- **Compliance Clarity**: Make it clear what regulations apply and how this product meets them.
- **Environmental Reminder**: Last 15-30 seconds point to the EDS for complete environmental details.
- **Positive Framing**: Highlight what makes the product better, not what other products lack.
