## Slide 2: Slow Drying or No Drying

### Narrative
If ARROYO® 1K isn't drying properly, several factors could be responsible.

**Temperature:** If your shop is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, drying will be extremely slow. Waterborne products are moisture-dependent, and temperature below 50 degrees can essentially halt drying. Solution: Increase temperature to 50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Humidity:** Relative humidity above 85 percent prevents proper drying. High humidity saturates the air, preventing water evaporation. Solution: Decrease humidity to 40 to 70 percent with dehumidifiers or increased ventilation.

**Poor Ventilation:** Without air circulation, water-laden air builds up around the piece. Solution: Increase air circulation with fans, but avoid direct drafts on the wet finish.

**Contamination:** If the surface was contaminated with wax or silicone, the finish won't dry properly. Solution: Strip and resand before reapplying.

## Slide 3: Visible Brush Marks

### Narrative
Brush marks appear as visible streaks or ridges in the dried finish.

**Causes:**
- Brush too small or of poor quality
- Over-brushing or excessive back-brushing
- Finish drying too quickly before leveling
- Insufficient flow of the material

**Solutions:**
- Use larger, higher-quality synthetic brushes
- Apply with smooth, confident strokes; avoid over-brushing
- "Tip off" by lightly dragging a dry brush across the surface
- Ensure proper environmental conditions for gradual drying
- Consider spray application for more uniform results
- Use the next coat to bridge brush marks from previous coats

---

## Slide 4: Runs and Sags

### Narrative
Runs and sags occur when too much material is applied in one area, causing it to flow downward.

**Causes:**
- Applying too much material
- Insufficient flash-off time between coats
- Spray gun held too close to surface
- Excessive back-brushing that creates thick spots
- Temperature too warm, extending wet time

**Solutions:**
- Apply thinner coats; multiple thin coats are better than fewer heavy ones
- Increase flash-off time between coats
- Maintain proper spray distance (8 to 10 inches)
- Use proper brushing technique without excessive back-brushing
- If runs occur, sand them out once fully dry before subsequent coats
- Maintain proper temperature range

---

## Slide 5: Orange Peel Texture

### Narrative
Orange peel texture resembles the bumpy surface of an orange rather than a smooth finish.

**Causes:**
- Spray gun too far from surface
- Spray pressure too high
- Insufficient atomization
- Material too thick or not properly strained
- Environmental conditions causing rapid drying
- Poor spray technique

**Solutions:**
- Maintain proper spray distance (8 to 10 inches)
- Adjust spray pressure for proper atomization
- Verify equipment is functioning correctly
- Thin material slightly with water if needed
- Strain material through 200-mesh screen
- Sand orange peel texture with fine sandpaper and apply additional coat

## Slide 6: Fish-Eye and Crawling

### Narrative
Fish-eye appears as small circular defects where finish pulls away, creating visible crater-like areas.

**Cause:** Contamination on the surface—typically silicone, wax, or oils.

**Solutions:**
- Complete stripping and resanding of the surface
- Use a dewaxing solvent or silicone remover before finishing
- Clean equipment thoroughly before use
- Verify that stain and previous coats don't contain silicone
- In future applications, ensure meticulous surface cleaning
- As a last resort, add fish-eye eliminator to ARROYO® 1K (follow product instructions)

---

## Slide 7: Adhesion Failure and Peeling

### Narrative
If ARROYO® 1K peels or flakes off, adhesion has failed.

**Causes:**
- Inadequate surface preparation
- Contamination beneath the finish
- Applying over incompatible primer or sealer
- Inadequate sanding between coats
- Moisture in the wood or on the surface

**Solutions:**
- Strip completely and restart with proper preparation
- Sand surface to bare wood if contamination is suspected
- Verify all primers and sealers are compatible with water-based topcoats
- Always sand between coats with 220-grit or finer sandpaper
- Ensure wood moisture content is 8 to 12 percent
- Use only waterborne primers and sealers under ARROYO® 1K

---

## Slide 8: Blotchy or Uneven Color

### Narrative
Blotchy appearance indicates uneven stain absorption or finish application.

**Causes:**
- Inadequate wood conditioning on absorbent woods
- Uneven stain application
- Dust contamination during drying
- Uneven topcoat application
- Grain raising not sanded out after staining

**Solutions:**
- Use wood conditioner on all softwoods and absorbent hardwoods
- Apply stain uniformly with brush or spray
- Sand raised grain after staining
- Remove all dust before topcoating
- Apply topcoat evenly with consistent technique
- Use spraying rather than brushing for more uniform color

---

## Slide 9: Excessive Foam or Bubbles

### Narrative
Visible bubbles in the wet finish or foam appearing on the surface.

**Causes:**
- Shaking the container instead of stirring
- Air being incorporated during application
- Spray gun atomization issues
- Material thinned excessively with water
- High humidity trapping moisture in the film

**Solutions:**
- Gently stir material rather than shaking
- Avoid vigorous brush strokes that incorporate air
- Verify spray equipment is functioning properly
- Add water very sparingly; don't over-thin
- Increase air circulation in the work area
- Reduce humidity if possible
- Sand and recoat if bubbles remain after drying

## Slide 10: Poor Flow and Leveling

### Narrative
Material that doesn't flow smoothly or leaves visible application marks has leveling issues.

**Causes:**
- Material too thick
- Environmental conditions too hot, causing rapid drying
- Inadequate brush quality or technique
- Surface preparation rough or uneven
- Material aged or improperly stored

**Solutions:**
- Thin material slightly with water (not more than 10 percent)
- Ensure proper temperature range (50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Use larger, higher-quality synthetic brushes
- Ensure proper surface preparation with fine-grit sandpaper
- Use tip-off technique to improve leveling
- Verify material hasn't exceeded shelf life
- Consider spray application for better flow

## Slide 11: Yellowing or Color Shift

### Narrative
If ARROYO® 1K appears yellowed or has changed color, investigate the cause.

**Causes:**
- Excessive UV exposure (waterborne finishes are not UV-resistant)
- Contamination during application
- Reaction with underlying stain or sealer
- Material degradation due to age or improper storage
- Additives or colorants inadvertently added

**Solutions:**
- Note that ARROYO® 1K does not contain UV protection; outdoor pieces may yellow over time
- Ensure clean application environment free of contaminants
- Verify compatibility of underlying finishes
- Check material hasn't exceeded shelf life
- Verify no additives were accidentally added
- Consider UV-protective topcoat for outdoor or high-light areas

## Slide 12: Hard to Recoat or Adhesion of Second Coat

### Narrative
If subsequent coats won't adhere to the first coat, sanding was likely skipped.

**Cause:** The first coat is too smooth for the second coat to grip.

**Solution:**
- Sand the first coat with 220-grit or finer sandpaper
- Use light pressure; you're creating tooth, not removing the finish
- Remove all dust with a tack cloth
- This sanding step is critical between every coat

**Prevention:** Never skip sanding between coats, even if the time between applications is short.

---

## Slide 13: Surface Feels Rough or Gritty

### Narrative
A rough finish indicates dust or foreign particles trapped in the dried finish.

**Causes:**
- Dust contamination during application or drying
- Material not properly strained before application
- Dirty application equipment
- Poor dust control in the work area

**Solutions:**
- Prevention is better than cure: use tack cloths and maintain dust control
- Strain all material through 200-mesh screen before application
- Clean all equipment thoroughly before use
- Sand with fine sandpaper and recoat if roughness is minor
- For significant defects, strip and restart
