## ✍️ Script Format Guide

Our scripts follow a consistent structure for video production:

### Basic Structure
```markdown
# Product Name - Module Title

## Video Overview
Brief description of what this module covers

---

## Slide 1: Title of Slide

### Narrative
The spoken content that will be converted to audio.
Write this naturally, as if you're speaking directly to a trainee.

Use short paragraphs for easier reading and pacing.

---

## Slide 2: Another Slide Title

### Narrative
More spoken content here...
```

### Key Rules

#### ✅ DO:
- **Write conversationally** - imagine you're talking to someone
- **Use short sentences** - easier for listeners to follow
- **Break into paragraphs** - natural pauses in speech
- **Include bullet points** - when listing features or specs
- **Define technical terms** - explain acronyms the first time
- **Use active voice** - "Apply the topcoat" not "The topcoat should be applied"

#### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't use all caps except for product names (ARROYO®)
- Don't write super long paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Don't assume technical knowledge
- Don't use jargon without explanation
- Don't forget the trademark symbols (® ™)

---

## 📐 Script Writing Best Practices

### 1. Conversational Tone
**Bad:** "The aforementioned topcoat product possesses characteristics..."  
**Good:** "This topcoat has several standout features..."

### 2. Clear Structure
Each slide should have:
- **Title** - Clear, descriptive (5-10 words)
- **Narrative** - 100-200 words of spoken content
- **Duration** - Aim for 1-2 minutes per slide

### 3. Product Terminology

#### Always Include Trademarks:
- ARROYO® (with ®)
- M.L. Campbell (no special marks)
- Any branded product names

#### Technical Terms to Define:
- VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)
- 1K (one-component)
- Waterborne (water-based)
- Topcoat (protective finishing layer)

### 4. Pacing and Flow

**Ideal slide narration:**
- Opening: What we'll cover (10-15 sec)
- Body: Main content (45-60 sec)
- Closing: Transition or summary (10-15 sec)
- **Total: 60-90 seconds per slide**

### 5. Audience Awareness

Write for **professional finishers** who:
- Understand basic woodworking
- May be new to waterborne products
- Want practical, actionable information
- Value both performance and safety

## 📝 Common Edits and Fixes

### Fixing Typos
Just correct them! Small typos can be fixed anytime.

### Improving Clarity
If something sounds confusing, rewrite it more simply:
- **Before:** "Utilize the applicator to achieve optimal coverage"
- **After:** "Use a brush or sprayer for even coverage"

### Adding Detail
If content feels thin, add:
- Specific examples
- Real-world applications
- Benefits or advantages
- Common questions answered

### Reducing Length
If a slide is too long (>150 words), try:
- Splitting into two slides
- Cutting unnecessary words
- Moving details to another module

---

## 🎨 Markdown Formatting Quick Reference

You don't need to be an expert, but these basics help:

```markdown
# Large Heading (Slide Title)
## Medium Heading (Section)
### Small Heading (Narrative Label)

**Bold Text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for product names

- Bullet point lists
- Another bullet point
  - Nested bullet (indent with 2 spaces)

1. Numbered lists
2. Second item
3. Third item

---
(Three dashes make a horizontal line - use between slides)
```

---

## 🎓 Example: Before and After

### ❌ Before (Needs Improvement)
```markdown
## Slide 3: Features

### Narrative
The product has many features that make it good. It dries fast and is hard. The VOC is low. People like it because it works well and is easy to use for finishing wood.
```

**Problems:**
- Too vague ("many features," "good")
- No specific details
- Doesn't define VOC
- Poor structure

### ✅ After (Much Better!)
```markdown
## Slide 3: Key Features

### Narrative
Let's look at the standout features that make ARROYO® 1K a preferred choice for professional finishers.

**Crystal Clear Clarity:** ARROYO® 1K provides outstanding transparency, allowing the natural beauty of wood grain to shine through while maintaining a brilliant white appearance.

**Low VOC Compliance:** With its waterborne formula, ARROYO® 1K meets strict VOC regulations—that's Volatile Organic Compound regulations—in all regions, making it suitable for any shop location.

**Superior Hardness:** Despite being water-based, ARROYO® 1K delivers hardness ratings comparable to traditional solvent-based topcoats, protecting your finished pieces from daily wear.

**Quick Recoat Times:** You can recoat in as little as two to four hours, keeping your projects moving efficiently.
```

**Improvements:**
- Specific features with descriptive names
- Real benefits explained
- VOC defined
- Professional but conversational
- Structured with bold headers
