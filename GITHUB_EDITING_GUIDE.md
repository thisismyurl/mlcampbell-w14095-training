### ✅ Safe to Change
- **Narrative text** under each slide
- Wording, phrasing, explanations
- Adding or removing bullet points
- Fixing typos
- Improving clarity

### ⚠️ Be Careful With
- **Product names** - keep ARROYO® with ®
- **Technical specs** - verify accuracy
- **Slide numbers** - keep sequential
- **HTML comments** - the `<!-- notes -->` parts

### ❌ Don't Touch
- File names or structure
- Code in .ps1 files
- The `---` slide separators

## 💡 Editing Tips

### Good Changes
✅ "Crystal Clear Clarity" → "Exceptional Clarity"  
✅ Adding an example: "For instance, kitchen cabinets benefit from..."  
✅ Shortening: Remove redundant words  
✅ Fixing: "it's" → "its" (grammar)

### Changes to Avoid
❌ Removing trademark symbols: ARROYO® → ARROYO  
❌ Adding unverified claims: "world's best topcoat"  
❌ Making slides too long (keep under 150 words)  
❌ Changing technical data without verification
